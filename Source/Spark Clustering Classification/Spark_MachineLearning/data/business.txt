this is for employers only is it good to is it good for a potential employee to send a thank you letter after an interview does it sway your decision to hire them at all for instance. If you interview two people with the same qualifications and skill level and one send a thank you letter and the other doesn't whom are you more likely to hire also does it seem to desperate or you find it flattering i'm asking because i interviewed for a position that was my dream job. I sent them a thank you letter to let them know that i appreciated the opportunity to interview i don't want to necessarily sway them but i want them to know that i am really interested and would work really hard for them i am hoping that they will see that i am sincere and really want the opportunity to show them what i can do is that bad when i went on the interview. I know i sold myself but since i know that they probaly conducted many interviews i thought that writing them a thank you would put a fresh mark in their minds that i am still out there they told me i was at the top of their list i'm sure they haven't forgotten i just wanted to be nice and say thank you i was truly blessed to even have the opportunity to interview for these people as an employer a thank you note would be a nice touch if i had two or three people running close for the position and one sent a thank you note i wouldn't say it would make me hire them but it would make me keep them in the front of mind just because like you said its a little reminder of who you are good luck to you  New York Giants Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.
